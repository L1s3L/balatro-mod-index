# GARBSHIT: Garb's Self-Indulgent Joker Pack

## ![Garb's Soul Sprite](https://github.com/Gainumki/GARBSHIT/blob/main/garb.png) > Hi! I'm Garb! I make Jokers!

## The Mod
Every Joker and art in this mod is made by me unless stated otherwise

I make these Jokers (And misc stuff too as of now) for myself but i figure people might enjoy them, so they're available to download!

There are currently 31 Jokers in this mod, more will be on the way :]

There's also a few consumables and enhancements, more of that coming soon too, stay tuned!!

Check the repository every once in a while for updates :33

## Special Thanks
Special thanks to Localthunk for making Balatro and to the Balatro discord (especially the people over on #modding-dev) for helping me whenever I had any issues, y'all the best >8]
